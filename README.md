# PORTFOLIO
For this callenge I have made two files "index.html " and "style.css". For index.html -I have included a header tag,article tag ,section tag,image tag,anchor tag,footer tag and list tag With the help of there tags I was able to make my portfolio without any css For style.css - I have made boxes for header tag,section tag,footer tag and article tag,I have even done some changes in the my picture by giving it an animation.THE images are provided with a hover animtion called shake. the left border which is coloured in every boxes changes color with animation.I have provided a background image. Self-decleration:I have not used any AI tool in the index.html file and most of the style.css was done by me .I have used co-pilot and w3school in making the boxes of the section more perfect by aligning and changing the value.
